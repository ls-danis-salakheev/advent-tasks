#### Task 2
For example, suppose you have the following list:
> 1-3 a: abcde 
> 
> 1-3 b: cdefg

> 2-9 c: ccccccccc

Each line gives the password policy and then the password. 
The password policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must appear for the password to be valid. 
For example, `1-3` a means that the password must contain a at least `1` time and at most `3` times.
